Then I roast it, and then I dry it, and then I slow roast it, add some mushrooms, and some saute sauce, and I suck on it.  Then I cut it into pieces and I eat it like a French lady.  I cut them into tiny pieces, but then I invent a robotic penis, and they're is fine, just like how Genji has a robotic penis.  So I eat their dick with a lot of saute sauce, and I slowly chew it.  It’s soft, with a nice texture, but it’s also hard on it inside, and then I realize there’s still some semen left in it, so I poop out a baby."
